 This  boilerplate theme for Wordpress is inspired by the great article 'Grunt is not weird and hard' from Chris Coyier, published in the 24ways website in 2013. http://24ways.org/2013/grunt-is-not-weird-and-hard/

 Based on this great article I've made a simple 3 step Grunt based Child theme boilerplate for Wordpress. Hopefully this wil improve your development in Wordpress.

 In this example I admit you've allready installed NodeJS & Grunt and use the latest stable Wordpress(Including Twentyfifteen). If not? No worrie. http://gruntjs.com/installing-grunt or nodejs.


Installation process
1. Download the source from Git in the themes directory located in the wp-content of your prefered webdev environment on your local machine.

2. Activate the Twentyfifteen theme and Twentyfifteen Child theme in the Wordpress backendinterface.

3. Open the terminal and type 'grunt'. From now on you can edit and add styles in the child-theme.
